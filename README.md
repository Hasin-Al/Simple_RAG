## Overview

This notebook demonstrates the implementation of a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Bag of Words and embedding methods. The goal is to create a system that retrieves relevant documents based on user queries, leveraging the power of embeddings for similarity search.

## Key Components

1. **Bag of Words Model**: 
   - This foundational model transforms text into a matrix representation, where each row corresponds to a document and each column corresponds to a word from the corpus. This allows for easy manipulation and retrieval based on word frequency.

2. **Embedding Method**:
   - The notebook utilizes embeddings from the `SentenceTransformer` library to convert text data into high-dimensional vectors. This step captures semantic relationships between words and phrases, enabling more nuanced similarity comparisons.

3. **FAISS for Similarity Search**:
   - The FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) library is employed to efficiently index and search through the embeddings. FAISS allows for fast nearest-neighbor searches, making it ideal for large datasets where quick retrieval is essential.

## Functionality

- The system accepts user queries and retrieves the top relevant documents based on similarity scores. If no relevant documents are found, it provides a simple response indicating the absence of results.

## Usage

1. **Installation**: Ensure that the required libraries are installed. You can install them using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy sentence-transformers faiss-cpu
